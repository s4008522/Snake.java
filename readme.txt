V1 - Snakeeeeeeeeeee! (0:54 03/07/2024)
You can move any direction you want. The only exception is that you cannot 
for example go up then down, or right than left.

- Haven't programmed a restart function (may do it in the future idk). 
- Every time you lose you gotta close the program.
- No High Score Either.

You can adjust the speed of the snake in SnakeGame.java on Line 56.
Change the number in the brackets, the higher/lower you go the slower/faster the snake goes respectively.
